            Heroes – men and women who defy the mortal realm.<br>
            Their deeds, that are seemingly of the impossible<br>
            Are achieved by the might of their skill:<br>
            The thunder of raving swords, with blood thumping applause,<br>
            The clashing of otherworldly foes to awaken any god’s slumber.<br>
            By the pain of their blood, the stress of their sweat,<br>
            And by the humanly tears that would make any water weep,<br>
            They do the seemingly impossible, and in return they<br>
            Step into the mortal realm with their glory, fame, and honor.<br>
            <br>
            What was I in comparison to these mortal gods?<br>
            A lowly solider I once was, good on the battlefield I may be,<br>
            Will never compare to the likes of those giants.<br>
            The titans made in human form,<br>
            The ones who have the ears of the gods,<br>
            For they are blessed and cursed to forevermore<br>
            Be the ones reaching into the likes of divinity.<br>
            <br>
            How can I be a hero? How can I be like them?<br>
            Those questions would oft be on my mind<br>
            When I continue the wary path,<br>
            Moving from town to town, city to city,<br>
            After my younger days living the life of a warrior,<br>
            Seeking my glory, and if the gods demand it,<br>
            A great death on the battlefield.<br>
            So, when it was that one day under the auspice of night,<br>
            With the full moon up above, nor any clouds obstructing,<br>
            That I find a narrow field between the mighty forest trees.<br>
            I began to set up the camp, with the campfire running tinder aflame,<br>
            The surrounding ambiance making a mockery<br>
            Of its daylight counterpart from the crickets chirping,<br>
            The soothing quiet akin to peaceful spirits.<br>
            If this is what the Elysium Fields look like in the afterlife,<br>
            Then when I die, I hope to find my eternal rest there.<br>
            <br>
            But sadly, while the rest of the world goes quietly by<br>
            For me my senses alerted me to the chill in the air,<br>
            With the sweat on the back and the fear apparent,<br>
            I knew by the state of the much too quiet silence<br>
            That there is something hiding in the woods.<br>
            <br>
            I kept to my relaxed position<br>
            And a false calming façade,<br>
            But I knew that whatever<br>
            Is stalking the woods at this time of night,<br>
            Where the full moon shines with no clouds overhead,<br>
            The stars shining brightly onto the worldly visage,<br>
            That whatever is out there is no human.<br>
            How I knew that I could never say,<br>
            But worse than the greatest terror I had ever felt<br>
            I now experienced worse at this present moment.<br>
            <br>
            At that moment, where time seemed immemorial,<br>
            Came a beast shall forevermore be burned into my memory:<br>
            A beast of lion make, but unlike any ordinary lion.<br>
            I rolled out of the way, with sword in my hand<br>
            Facing the mythical lion with dread but steadfast courage.<br>
            I knew of the fate that most likely await me,<br>
            But until such a time happens,<br>
            The Underworld will not take me this day!<br>
            <br>
            So, with a warlike scream I charged,<br>
            The lion returned with claws enlarged,<br>
            Its roar from its maw making way<br>
            For what undoubtedly would be its prey,<br>
            I strike with caution; the lions claws landing late,<br>
            A sword strike is earned, starting the test of fate.<br>
            The lion roared to the heavens, its intentions clear,<br>
            My greatest battle I charged again overcoming my fear,<br>
            The lion raced and jumped quick like a hare,<br>
            Barely just reaching the breadth of my hair,<br>
            I slide underneath, the lions back turned,<br>
            A slash of blood I gave and earned,<br>
            But in return its quick nature launched an attack,<br>
            Of which landed me on my back.<br>
            My sword got knocked out from me,<br>
            And my chest is blooded, its claw pattern evident to see,<br>
            The lion slowly stalking, see that its prey is down,<br>
            But don’t expect me to be down for the count!<br>
            <br>
            <i>And so, I pretended to be weak, my breath on fire,<br>
            My veins wrought with fury most dire.<br>
            Like heroes of old, this lion will earn my ire,<br>
            And shall go down over gods inspire!</i><br>
            <br>
            When the lion came close to launch the killing blow,<br>
            I rolled like silent lighting, with sword in hand.<br>
            Raise my sword in a horizontal position<br>
            Against the base of its neck,<br>
            Over which its blood detached dead.<br>
            <br>
            Now like the rest of the world it becomes silent.<br>
            My breath is struggling, my chest in pain,<br>
            The battle-high of survival and fear wearing off.<br>
            I can see the rising dawn coming over the forest walls,<br>
            And to become the deed of my trophy I took the lion’s head.<br>
            Beheaded from its bodily state I went to continue<br>
            The trek to my ancestral home.<br>
            <br>
            Thinking now, am I a hero?<br>
            I who did the heroic deed of slaying a beast.<br>
            Me who someone overcome a seemingly impossible<br>
            Task fit for heroes and gods?<br>
            <br>
            <i>In the town of my people, when they look at the lion’s head,<br>
            They stand silent at the man who did the impossible mortal stead.</i><br>

          <h1 class="font-ubuntu">Eyes Upon Me</h1>
          <p class="font-roboto">
            Creep in this hallow woods, with trees of seemingly eyes,<br>
            They track and seek and see all that happens:<br>
            Do they speak like humans do, or do they speak silently?<br>
            The judgmental look we should feel; of passing shame<br>
            But nothing does the wicked way come when one becomes lost.<br>
            <br>
            I feel like everything is, but no one is watching me.<br>
            The crows and ravens, speaking nevermore,<br>
            Thus kindly I speak with craws and knows,<br>
            The million fireflies lighting, sparking, with buzzing passerby.<br>
            The grass and leaves whistling like shaking thunder,<br>
            The crickets humming with frequent passion.<br>
            I stand on top of dirt road, untraveled and unwarded<br>
            Through the supernatural I fear has come:<br>
            I see nor spy the watch upon my visage,<br>
            But feel the same that are <i>eyes upon me.</i><br>
            <br>
            Do the trees see, or the fear I think is messing with my mind?<br>
            Bristle with the nightly branches; nightly full moon overhead.<br>
            And out of the fright of the weeping silence a howl arose.<br>
            Shadows moving about, too quick for the average eyes:<br>
            Something is here, bipedal in nature… no, it could not be.<br>
            <br>
            A noise behind me, a noise of the left… then the right.<br>
            All times I checked, and saw with a high certainty:<br>
            A <i>werewolf.</i><br>
            <br>
            And the howling comes nearer and comes more in nature.<br>
            <br>
            A scream, and rage of immense aura I notice,<br>
            <i>Even at this distance?</i><br>
            <br>
            And out comes the beast in question, no doubt I see,<br>
            The trees, they are most likely crackling at my perceived slight:<br>
            Whether it be on my honor or at the time of my impending doom<br>
            Know I do not the true preciosity of the eyes.<br>
            <br>
            The werewolf is in front of me, and as if on timely queue,<br>
            The overhead full moon shines brightly onto the beastly visage,<br>
            The fur, though black, strikes softly and smooth.<br>
            The head, with full muzzle, open with sharp teeth,<br>
            And the arms elongated with killing claws.<br>
            <br>
            The werewolf stopped, only looking at me.<br>
            I stared back as well, too frighten to make any sudden moves.<br>
            <br>
            Though the eyes of the werewolf, I can see with no mistake:<br>
            The werewolf, while seemingly stereotypical of beastly nature,<br>
            Is intelligent. I suspect this werewolf is a human.<br>
            A wolf-shifter? And how does the world shatter when faced with the new?<br>
            Or dare I say old, with the mythological nature of a werewolf?<br>
            Supernatural I never saw before, but now a true believer:<br>
            The werewolf, in its eyes, are filled with rage.<br>
            <br>
            In death, I suppose, my time has come.<br>
            I shut my eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Then seconds’ pass. I heard the sound of trampled grass,<br>
            And when nothing occurs onto my person,<br>
            I open my eyes only to see the werewolf gone.<br>
            And seemingly of the like-nature disappearance<br>
            Like the confoundment evidence of a werewolf never even here.<br>
            <br>
            Was the werewolf a figment of my imagination…?<br>
            No. The werewolf was too real in nature.<br>
            I saw it. I do not doubt.<br>
            Nothing is here now, and with no evidence to prove my claim.<br>
            But I know… and this werewolf, maybe we will<br>
            See each other someday, but for now…<br>
            <br>
            I will track my way throughout the light,<br>
            The lost day I feared will end in fright:<br>
            Through the windows of the eyes<br>
            That trek into the soul, whichever so happens<br>
            That an encounter like mind:<br>
            Go to at the end of the path,<br>
            And see the civilization I left behind.<br>
