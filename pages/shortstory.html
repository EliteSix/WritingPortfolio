          <p class="font-roboto">
            Richard Marshire wondered when everything went wrong.<br>
            Here he was, sipping on what is probably the last of his whiskey – which reminds him that he needed to get more – and went reminiscing. He was an off duty homicide detective for the Portland P.D., though technically he was on paid leave,
            and he still felt the scars of the pain from three months ago.<br>
            Richard’s wife, his dear departed Lila, was murdered from a botched robbery at a convenience store three months ago. At the time, he was working at his desk at his precinct before the call. That dreaded call that made all time stop. His
            breathing held still, and one of the coldest shivers he ever experienced in his life went down his spine. He remembered when the call came from the hospital; she died before she made it to the hospital. Then it was told by one of his
            fellow officers the bad news of the founding circumstances of the robbery. The investigation was just starting, and out of everything he had to go see his wife… though it would be a final goodbye, not a “hey, how are you?”<br>
            He left immediately heading straight to the hospital, but not before informing his immediate superior who told him to “Get the hell out already!” As he arrived, he headed not to the treatment part of the hospital and instead headed for
            the morgue. Lila was already dead; all was left was to see her body… and provide the needed funeral arrangements. But at the time, all Richard could think about was “she’s gone. She’s dead. Why? Why? Why!?”<br>
            The funeral was arranged three weeks after Lily’s death. Much of Lila’s family made it, though some of them he noticed were a bit joyful that she was gone. Lila could be a… handful at times, though not everything was peaches and roses
            with her family. Gods only know that Richard’s family was not all sunshine and rainbows. Especially his deadbeat of a brother…<br>
            Richard was the one to give her eulogy at the funeral, and it reminded a lot of the listeners his reputation as the “stoic bastard.” He spoke only that while there were ups and downs over the course of their marriage, that they were
            happy, and by goodness were the good times some of the best moments of his life. He notably ended the eulogy with, “Above all I say this, and I say this most for all for me personally, that she’ll be sorely missed. May you rest in peace,
            Lila…”<br>
            . . .
            Richard finished the last of his whiskey – the final one – and contemplated. He was set to return back to his work within a week, but he used a lot of his vacation time during those three months of absence before he felt ready to return.
            It would be an insult to the work he does and mostly himself if he were not the best he could be. His pride practically demanded it.<br>
            As such he put his empty glass into the sink and went into the bathroom. He noted that he reeked and hadn’t showered in a while. While looking at the mirror, he could see his reflection. His stubble was wild and unshaven, and his brown
            hair was wild and unkempt. His green eyes were ferocious and absolute, at least in his opinion, and above all else focused. It was about time he moved on, (though he reckon moved on a while ago, and was now not focusing on the sorrow of
            his dead, and instead to better himself). He abandoned his earlier plan of buying more alcohol – though he could always be fine with more whiskey – and set himself to get ready for the day.<br>
            . . .<br>
            It was reaching about the time of the afternoon before Richard heard his doorbell ring.<br>
            Confused on who it may be since really no one has bothered to visited except the first few weeks after Lila’s death he went up to the door. After looking through the peephole located at the center of the door, his eyes lit up in surprise
            when he saw who it was.<br>
            It was his partner Alex.<br>
            Richard opened the door apprehensively and looked upon the form of Alex.<br>
            Alex was a tall six foot male, with black hair and blue eyes. His glasses, worn and torn from the amount of use and time passed, rested upon his eyes, and stared blankly at Richard. Due to the coldness of the surrounding weather, Alex was
            wearing a dark, light layered coat, and form-fitting jeans. He also had the appearance of being in his later twenties to early thirties. His outfit seemed informal so that to Richard seemed like a casual visit instead of a work-related
            visit. Though by the stern but unease in his gate and the nature of his face told that this was not a casual visit. Alex was also holding under his armpit a folder. Alex wanted to discuss something with him.<br>
            “Hello Alex.” Richard begins.<br>
            “Richard. Good to see you alive and well.” Alex replied, then by noticing the cleaner stature of his partner, continued. “Seems like you are moving are since Lila’s death. Are you?”<br>
            “It’s been… touch and go. I miss her though Lila wouldn’t want me to wallow in self-pity for the rest of my life. It’s been months. I need to move on.”<br>
            “Good to hear. Very good, in fact because I need to discuss something with you. May I?” He motioned his hand into the door.<br>
            Richard, not minding, acquiesced, and moved out of the way allowing Alex entrance. “Sure, go ahead.”<br>
            As Alex entered into Richard’s apartment, both of the men made their way into the living room. Their destination was a table on the far side of the room, near the kitchen. Both of them took opposite sides of the table, pulled back their
            chairs and sat down.<br>
            Alex put down the folder he was carrying and opened it. Richard, noticing the contents of the folder, immediately made the connection of the reason why Alex was here.<br>
            “You’re here to discuss a case.” Richard grimaced. “You know I don’t officially come back until a few days from now, right?”<br>
            “Yes, but this case Richard… it has everyone who is working on it stumped. We have exhausted all possible leads we can find, and it seems like the case is going to become cold if we don’t find something. I know you Richard: your intuition
            and skill is among some of the best I ever known. I need your help.” Alex, with a face betraying a bit of worry and desperation, explained.<br>
            Richard, while thinking, replied slowly, “While it is nice to hear the praise, I can’t promise I can find anything, though…” Richard took a breath, then continued. “I see if I can provide any insight. Tell me about the case.”<br>
            Alex listened to Richard, then when he finished, smiled. “Good to hear it. You know, I miss having you around. I mean, don’t get me wrong, you’re still a stoic bastard and some of your methods can be left to be desired,” Alex chortled,
            “But you’re still a good investigator. Ever since you left, I been between three partners: the first was an asshole. The second was the human equivalent of a robot. And the last one was a rookie. Let me tell you about the last one, he
            would never shut up.” Alex sulked.<br>
            That got a laugh out of Richard and gave raise to a smile as well. “Well, at least you’re doing just great over there. Happy to hear your misery.”<br>
            “Happy to hear you take pleasure in my pain, you stoic bastard.” Alex tried to scowl, but a small smirk still shined through.<br>
            The banter between the two was a testament to how long the two of them were friends for. Alex, known by his full name Alexander Bancroft, had been Richard’s partner for about four years now, barring the three month absence from
            Richard.<br>
            Having Alex here also alleviated some of the emotional pain for Richard.<br>
            “So, the case, tell me.” Richard ordered. His face now serious.<br>
            Likewise, Alex became the same. “Three weeks ago, we received a 911 call at a high-rise apartment building downtown. The 911 caller didn’t anything and just left the line open. Hearing no response to their inquiries, whereby the 911
            operator located the call originating from the sixth floor of that apartment building, specifically from apartment 6C. The 911 operator sent officers to respond. Upon entrance into the apartment, the first responders found no obvious
            signs of foul play and they tried to ascertain the whereabouts of the owner of the apartment. As the officers were investigating the apartment, they found a dial-phone with its receiver out, so they assumed that to be the phone that
            called 911. Dealing aside the mysteriousness and creepy factor of the empty apartment, the officers made their way to the master bedroom. Upon which they discovered the victim lying stiff on the bed in a position as if he were
            electrocuted. It was the owner of the apartment, Noah Campbell.”<br>
            “Hmm… strange indeed. Who was Mr. Campbell?” Richard took in the information and asked.<br>
            “Member of the Board of Directors for Chief Titan Insurance. Had barely any family to speak of. His father died of cancer a decade ago, and his mother lives in a small town in Idaho. He was an only child and was 43 years old. Also he had
            no recent romantical partners.” Alex explained.<br>
            “How was he killed?” Richard went straight to the point.<br>
            Alex was somewhat taken aback. “How did you know he was killed? I never said he was murdered… oh. Right, wouldn’t be here if he weren’t.” Alex shifted a little in his seat, feeling a bit embarrassed.<br>
            Richard just rolled his eyes. “Tired much?”<br>
            “Due to the unique and frankly frustrating aspects of this case, it is indeed tiring. And after working this case… I am indeed exhausted.” Alex sighed. “You see the reason why I need your help now?”<br>
            “You were saying,” Richard reminded to get back on track.<br>
            “Right, Mr. Campbell was murdered, though there was no obvious or noticeable explanation into the cause of his death. If not for the extraordinary nature and abnormal causalities of the case itself, if Mr. Campbell were discovered on his
            lonesome the cause of death would most likely be declared natural causes. But Mr. Campbell was laid down on his bed, his body stiffer as if he were electrocuted – though there were no signs of torture – and…” Alex reached out into his
            pocket and laid on the table the object. Richard’s eyes immediately laid upon it.<br>
            “What’s this?” Richard examined the object.<br>
            The object in question was wrapped in an evidence bag. Inside the evidence bag was what seemed like a regular modern lock. The lock itself was locked, and there was no key alongside it.<br>
            “That, Richard,” Alex began as Richard stopped examining the lock and looked at Alex, “is what Noah Campbell had clenched in his right hand. Here, look at this.” Alex slid across the table a picture of the crime scene depicting the master
            bedroom of Noah Campbell’s apartment.<br>
            Richard looked at the details of the picture. The master bedroom was pristine, clean, and reeked of that new-modern design Richard never really understood. The floor was made out of oak hardwood, and the ceiling was a bit taller than most
            rooms. Around the backside of the wall were an array of clear windows reaching from the floor to the ceiling. An assorting array of darken curtains accompanied it atop the windows. Among some of the furniture were a few bookshelves, a
            dresser, a door that leads to a supplemented bathroom, and laying at the center of the room as a king-sized bed where Noah Campbell’s body was laying on the left side of the bed, nearest the wall of windows. It one would squint and make
            out the detail, on Noah Campbell’s right hand is shut tight, holding what looks like a lock.<br>
            “Me and my partner – the third one remember? The one that would never shut up – were called in. When we arrived the crime scene guys were already at it. They told us there was no signs of forced-entry, no signs of a robbery or
            home-invasion, no signs of any tools or weapons, and that there was no prints or hair follicles around the dial-phone or around the master-bedroom. Though the examination for DNA evidence and fingerprints took a while longer than the rest
            to discover. It sounded like the work of a professional hitman. We were all stumped trying to figure this out. Since there was barely any evidence to go off before we got the medical examiner’s report, we interviewed Mr. Campbell’s office
            and a bit afterwards got in touch with his mother. None of the interviews told us much. Noah Campbell didn’t have any enemies, he kept to himself, and was often reclusive. A common trait we heard was that he was a hard worker. There was a
            break in the case when we finally discover the cause of death: poison. The M.E. found a needle mark containing the poison Aconite, also known as Wolf’s Bane. While we had a lead to the cause of death it didn’t pan out due to the wide
            availability of Aconite being able to purchase from either online retail or stores since Aconite is commonly used in medicine. We figured the victim knew the unsub since there was no signs of invasion or forced-entry. We had the lab go
            through the lock hoping to find any unusual tampering or markings on it, but they had no such luck.” Alex sighed heavily and took a deep breath. “So, any insights you can give us would be much appreciated.”
            “Yeah, let me look at that lock.” Richard started to stand up. “Can I?”<br>
            “Be my guest.” Alex motioned his heads outward as if saying ‘go ahead.’<br>
            Richard made his way towards a cabinet which contains his latex gloves. The motto of “being prepared” certainly resonates and helps in this case. Richard pulled out two pairs of latex gloves, slapped the double-layer onto his hands and
            went back to the table. He opened the evidence bag and took out the lock into his hands.<br>
            Looking at the lock, he turned and closely examined around the entirety of it. He tried to pull out the lock though it stay firmly in place. In all honesty, if there was no other reason to examine the lock it would seem like an unassuming
            lock.<br>
            But Richard wasn’t just anyone. As everyone rightly assumed, their must be something more to this lock, and after shaking the lock up a bit and holding it by his ear, he swore he could hear the faintest sound of something moving inside
            the lock, though it was muffled. Suddenly curious why no one bother to look inside the lock, he turned to Alex.<br>
            “Did anyone examine the inside of the lock?”<br>
            Alex, who before was watching Richard examine the lock, was surprised by the sudden line of inquiry. “The inside… of the lock?”<br>
            “Yes! Did they?” Richard scowled lightly.<br>
            Alex went through his case folder until he reached the lab report. “It says here that they did.” Alex looked back up to Richard.<br>
            “Seems like they didn’t. Can I open this up? I think there is something hiding inside the lock.”<br><br>
            Alex was lightly worried and apprehensive to whether or not let Richard open up a key piece of evidence. Though that feeling quickly went away when he replied, “Sure.”<br>
            Richard immediately went to grab a small screwdriver from his toolbox hidden in a nearby room. After finding the screwdriver, he was back at the table, and slowly took out the small screws, where he finally opened up the lock.<br>
            Inside the lock was a key and a small note.<br>
            Alex, alarmed to see the things inside the lock, muttered, “What the…?”<br>
            Richard took out the key first. He looked at it briefly where he noticed the number ‘49’ at the top, then set it aside to read the note.<br>
            Upon laying out the note, and with squinting eyes, both Alex - who moved around the table to observe the note - and Richard read:<br>
            “X marks the spot. Treasure. Diamond Square Bank.”<br>
            . . .<br>
            Alex and Richard went immediately to Diamond Square Bank, located in Northeast Portland, by wat of Richard driving in his GT Mustang, and Alex located in the passenger seat was talking on the phone with their Sergeant.<br>
            Richard could hear various snippets of the nearby conversation but kept his eyes on the road.<br>
            “We’ll need a warrant if they won’t let us in.” Richard quickly remarked over to Alex, but it seems like he already thought of that.<br>
            “Got that covered.” Alex replied but turn his attention back to his call.<br>
            Soon they managed to reach the front entrance of the bank. The bank was typical in its appearance, with glass panes with blinders covering the interior of the front. The door was a dual-planal glass with a hooked handle. The bank was also
            only two stories in height.<br>
            They headed inside and went straight to one of the cashiers. Alex took the lead in the conversation holding out his badge.<br>
            “Detectives Bancroft and Marshire, we need to look at a security deposit box made out for Noah Campbell.”<br>
            The cashier, startled, looked at the detectives in surprise before smoothing her face. “Certainly, detectives, but without a warrant we can’t let anyone besides the customer access into our accounts and vaults. I’m apologize for the
            inconvenience.”<br>
            Though peeved, Richard and Alex expected this, and so they didn’t look that despondent with Alex replying, “I understand, the warrant is on its way, so can we…?”<br>
            The cashier, not budging, sternly said, “Until I see a warrant, there is nothing I can do. You can take a seat until the warrant comes or leave and come back with the warrant. Otherwise good day to both of you gentlemen.”<br>
            Offput, Richard and Alex took a seat and waited an hour before the warrant came in by a fellow detective of theirs.<br>
            Immediately they went back to the cashier, shoved the warrant close by away from her face, and Richard glibly said, “Now can we see Mr. Campbell’s deposit box?”<br>
            The cashier, seeing the warrant, looked miffed, but acquiesced to the order, and told the detectives, “Of course, please follow me.”<br>
            . . .<br>
            The cashier led them to the vault, said “Here we are,” and took her master key into one of the dual-locks for deposit box 49. Alex, holding onto the key, handed over the key to the cashier who inserted it into the other lock. After her
            jobs was done, she just silent left, leaving Alex and Richard alone in the vault.<br>
            They went to work. Laying the deposit box onto the table in the middle of vault, Richard opened up the medium-sized deposit box and looked inside.<br>
            “Let’s see what we have here…” Richard muttered.<br>
            Alex and Richard started to rummage and take out large piles and stacks of paper. Inspecting through the contents of the papers they found something pretty damning.<br>
            “Is this what I think it is?” Alex was shocked.<br>
            “I say it is. Proof of the illegal activities made by Chief Titan Insurance. There is proof of embezzlement, fraud, insider trading, and other such things.” Richard rummaged around more until he found something worse. “Alex, come look at
            this.”<br>
            Alex put down his stack of paper and took in his hands a pile that Richard gave to him.<br>
            “Assassination…!?” Alex’s eyebrows raised in alarm. “These tell of several murders made by the security of Chief Titan Insurance at the behest of their CEO Peter von Williams whenever their needed a problem of theirs go away.”
            “Yeah. It looks like Noah Campbell was in on it and had these papers as insurance in case something happen to him, or to use it as blackmail. I’m guessing that Peter von Williams had Noah Campbell killed. The reason for that? I don’t
            know. It was probably due to a disagreement turn violent or Campbell did try to blackmail Williams, and this was Williams’ response.”<br>
            “In any case, Richard, this is incredible! This is proof of Chief Titan Insurance’s wrongdoings! Though we may not have directly solve Noah Campbell’s murder, it does point us in a better direction. Thanks for the help Richard.” Alex
            exclaimed.<br>
            “No problem. Now call in for backup. I don’t want anything to happen to these papers and when Peter von Williams finds out about them, if he doesn’t know already, he’ll tried anything to get rid of them. He certainly has no problem
            getting rid of any enemies that gets in his way.”<br>
            “Don’t worried about that. I got it covered.” Alex smirked.<br>
            . . .<br>
            It’s been about two weeks since the uncovering of the evidence found at Diamond Square Bank. Peter von Williams was immediately arrested after the police found out he was planning to escape the country. Facing interrogation and damning
            amounts of federal and state crimes, Peter von Williams lawyered up and hadn’t said anything to any of the investigators. The murder of Noah Campbell remains unsolved for the time period, but due to the time Peter von Williams is facing
            for his other litany of crimes, it sounds like poetic justice to Richard. Though Peter von Williams most likely hired out to commit the murder, and until then Richard can wait to find more of the evidence. As like Alex said before, he was
            one hell of an investigator. Now from the time he was back at his desk at his precinct, he began looking and delving deeper into Noah Campbell’s records with the help of Alex.<br>
            Here’s hope to more justice… as Richard sips on more of his whiskey.<br>

            Portals. Ah, portals. You got to either love them or hate them. In my case, it was the, “What the hell is going on?!” one. Fun times. Yes, this portal was something of a shock to me. Okay, let’s say it was a total shock and surprise to my
            eyes. I was stunned for a little while before I got my bearings back. But oh boy! The adventures were so worth it, as I will tell you now.<br>
            Before I was launched and sucked into the portal, I was heading out from a round with the boys and things got a little heavy-headed. Arguments broke out and let’s just say fighting was involved. All of us were kicked out of the bar and I
            left for home. Two of the four of us left to find another bar, and the person I got into an argument into went in the other direction. That was the last time I ever saw any of them again. I doubt I will ever again.<br>
            As I was walking home, this giant portal launched out of the middle of nowhere, on a empty street no less! The portal started to pick up speed and started to suck in things into itself. I was one of the things that caught in that wind,
            and so I held as tight as I can onto a nearby street pole. But it was just then that my friend that I got into a fight with earlier came back to find me. Let’s just say his reaction was the same as mine.<br>
            “What in the hell is that!?” He shouted.<br>
            “That’s what I said!” I yelled back. “Help me! For god sakes, help me!”<br>
            “What can I do?” He said. Then he ran off. “Good luck with that!”<br>
            And he was gone. I didn’t hear him anymore. I gotten angry, and my words reflected that.<br>
            “You good-for-nothing son-of-a-bitch! Get back here and help me…!”<br>
            And at that moment I got sucked in right into the portal.<br>
            <br>
            Inside the portal was not as bad as I hoped, or originally thought. I could breathe in here, which was good. I could move; well, I couldn’t go anywhere since there was no land, or any land to land on. So I was drifting around here in this
            space, and I knew nothing of this place, or even what this portal place was. So I went off to sleep.<br>
            When I awoke, I notice to the sight of a foreign land, but different. I could hear the noise of a town nearby, so I stood up from the ground. That’s when I felt the sharp pain on my left arm, I looked to check to see what it was and saw
            it was a crown that was implanted into my skin, I couldn’t get it off.<br>
            “What in the hell? More weird crap?” I thought. “I better go check where I am, there must be a town or city somewhere.”<br>
            I looked around and saw the nearby town.<br>
            “There! Found one.”<br>
            And so I went down the hill towards the town. Man, this place was different. Everything looks so fresh and fantasy like. Like I’m from the basis of a fantasy world. Wow, it would be so cool to be in a fantasy world, with magic and
            warriors and heroes and kings! Wow, what an adventure it would be. But sadly, dreams don’t come to life like that. Unless that portal transported me somewhere like that.<br>
            When I got there, the town was like the towns of old, and nothing was familiar to me. It was stuff you learned out of history. The people were dressed the same way too, even the hairstyles! If it was a different time period, surely the
            language would be different, wouldn’t it?<br>
            Oddly enough, it wasn’t. I could hear them when I close enough that it was in a language I could understand, and it was strange. Was that a tourist attraction, an amusement or prank pulled on me? Whatever the case, I just need to figure
            out where I am and what’s my next move.<br>
            I went towards the middle of town before I was interrupted by a bystander who notice the crown tattoo on my arm.<br>
            “The Mark of the King! That guy has The Mark of the King! Look! Look!” The bystander shouted towards all the crowd.<br>
            “The Mark of the King?” Voices repeating the same words of the bystanders.<br>
            “I should go now.” I thought to myself.<br>
            I was then surrounded by the enormous crowd, and engulfed into a frenzy of people trying to look at my arm.<br>
            “Listen people! Listen! Get away from me, now!” I yelled at the top of my lungs, but I fear that would barely do anything to appease the crowd, but in actuality, it worked.<br>
            Some of the people closest to me backed off a little, and it gave me a little space to breathe.<br>
            “Thank you.” I thanked them.<br>
            “Do you truly have the Mark of the King?” One of the curious people asked.<br>
            “What’s the Mark of the King?”<br>
            He was shocked by that statement, “You don’t know about the Mark of the King? Where are you from?”<br>
            “That’s what I’m trying to figure out myself.” I replied back. “Where am I?”<br>
            “Why, you’re in the country of Velos. Don’t you know that?”<br>
            “I’m new here, don’t know the land.” I quickly said. “Now back to the topic at hand, what’s the Mark of the King?”<br>
            “Oh, it’s an old ancient prophecy that says, ‘He who bares the Mark of the King will turn the tides of wrong, your future king.’” The guy explained.<br>
            “You mean the Mark of the King indicants your future king?!?” I yelled?<br>
            “Do the Test!”<br>
            “Yes, the Test!”<br>
            “Make him prove himself by taking the Test!”<br>
            Members of all places in the crowd were saying for me to “take the Test!”<br>
            “What’s ‘the Test?’” I asked everyone.<br>
            “To the Test it is!” One of the decreed.<br>
            “NO ONE IS GOING ANYWHERE! What is going on here?” A woman ordered to the crowd. It looked like she was a guard. No, a commander of the guard. “What’s going on here? And don’t make me ask again.” She sighed.<br>
            “Commander, this man bores the Mark of the King!”<br>
            “The Mark of the King? Impossible. That’s myth and legend.”<br>
            “Look for yourself!”<br>
            “I’m right here, you know?” I butted in.<br>
            “Quiet, you.” The woman sneered.<br>
            The woman went up to me, and the crowd bowed down, as if the Commander was the Queen around here. She started by looking at my right arm and saw nothing. Then she proceeded to the left arm, and saw it.<br>
            “My god, it’s true.” She whispered.<br>
            “Yeah, this crown tattoo appeared out of nowhere.” I told her. “Who may you be?”<br>
            “I sense that you’re not from these lands, correct?”<br>
            “That seems to be the case.”<br>
            “Then I am Commander Galius, and this is the town of Kyul. I was just going pass this place when I heard all the shouting going on. I could hear the shouting from half a mile away. I thought monsters were attacking this place, but I think
            something equally as terrifying was put into its place.” Galius explained.<br>
            “Do I look like a monster?” I asked sarcastically.<br>
            “With the Mark of the King, you never know. For all I know, you’re just one of the many imposters trying to claim the crown for yourself. But out of all of them, you’re the first to have such a plausible Mark.” Galius stopped for a
            moment, then smiled suspiciously. “Normally, I would arrest you, but I like you, and the Mark seems to genuine… I think the Test could be valid to do. Marker, let’s go.”<br>
            “I’m not going anywhere until someone tell what this Test is.”<br>
            “You’ll do what I tell you too until you’re proved to be a true Marker-Holder.”<br>
            That guy from before who first noticed the Mark went to us and broke off the engagement, “Commander Galius! Master Marker! Please, this is no time to be bickering!”<br>
            “It seems like you have a friend now, isn’t it, Marker.” Galius sneered at me. “Next time Dielo, don’t interrupt me.”<br>
            I was too caught up by the name to focus any attention to Galius.<br>
            “Dielo, that’s you name, right?” I asked Dielo.<br>
            “That’s correct.” Dielo replied back.<br>
            “Marker? What does that mean?”<br>
            “It means a true king, a Marker, if your Mark is true, then you’re destined to be out future king.”<br>
            Now it makes more sense a little. “So that’s why so many people were imposters, right?”<br>
            Galius went right back, “That’s right. And if you’re an imposter, then the Test says we have to kill you.”<br>
            “Kill me?” I shouted.<br>
            “Yes, kill you.” Galius said. “But don’t worry, if your Mark is true, then you won’t die, and you’ll become our future king.” And she went on to whisper under her breath, “He better die.”<br>
            I overheard that, and went up to her furiously, “What the fuck you just say?!?”<br>
            Dielo got in my way and made me step back, and both of us walked around out of the crowd. When we got far away enough, we went on continue our conversation.<br>
            “Please, Master Marker, don’t provoke her. Galius hates anyone who wears a Mark of the King. If you had attack her, then she and her guard would kill you right where you stand!”<br>
            I stood still for a moment, trying to gather my thoughts together.<br>
            “What’s her problem then?” I asked Dielo.<br>
            “Galius… well… she’s married to King Arthur I. The king is her husband.” Dielo went to explain.<br>
            “Galius is the Queen!?!” I whispered loudly.<br>
            “The reason why of their hatred towards the Marker-Holder is because Galius’ brother and King Arthur’s best friend and advisor Eulu was murdered by a true Marker-Holder, and both of them had huge grudges against them ever since. But by
            ancient and God-decreed law, they can’t do anything, even if it’s an imposter unless proven otherwise. If an imposter is found out by the Test, then Galius and King Arthur would have reason to kill them.”<br>
            “What is this law you were talking about?”<br>
            “The Marker Law decreed by the Goddess Nula. The law states that any true Marker-Holder must first pass a Test to prove their worthiness. And if that Marker-Holder passes, then they would become the next King/Queen.”<br>
            “What happens if I attack or provoke any one of them?”<br>
            “Then by God-Law and Man-Law they can kill you, Marker-Holder or not; not until you proven yourself.”<br>
            “It seems like I have to take this Test. But I have been meaning to ask, why did everyone jumped on me when you first noticed my Mark?”<br>
            “Our people… the Veloians… are enslaved and forced to work for the tyrant King Arthur. Your coming gave us a sign of hope since the last imposter was killed a hundred years ago.”<br>
            “You talk about it like you were there yourself when it all started.”<br>
            “I was there when it all began, two hundred and thirty-six years ago.”<br>
            “What? No, you’re joking.” I was hesitated for a second, thinking that he was only joking. “Right?”<br>
            “Does it look like I’m joking?”<br>
            “You’re over 236 years old right now?”<br>
            “More like 250, but who's counting right?”<br>
            “You look good… for your age.” I tried to haphazardly compliment him. Then I whispered, “Wow.”<br>
            “I heard that.”<br>
            He heard that.<br>
            “So I was seen as a sign of hope then?”<br>
            “Yes, and I believe you are a true Marker-Holder.”<br>
            “Sweet. More trouble for my luck. Now I got a prophecy to fulfill. A crazy bitch on my ass, and a tyrant king to top it all off when word gets back to him.” Then it came to cross my mind, “By the way, how can you guys speak perfectly in
            my language?”<br>
            “Aren’t you speaking Veloian?”<br>
            “No, I’m speaking my own language from my own land.”<br>
            “‘And so shall the language barrier become helpless in its task for a true Marker-Holder. May it be a sign for a true Marker-Holder.’” Dielo recited.<br>
            “What’s that?” I asked curiously.<br>
            “One of Seven Signs of a true Marker-Holder, just in case the Test doesn’t work out for a true Marker-Holder.”<br>
            “I forgot to ask, what is this Test everyone’s asking me to take?”<br>
            “The Test, that may take awhile.”<br>
            “I got time.”<br>
            “Then sit, I’ll tell the story.”<br>
