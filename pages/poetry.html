            I do not know where my<br>
            Worries shall go. Here? There?<br>
            Across the meadow into the overland?<br>
            Or maybe just a quaint little town<br>
            Where everyone shall know you:<br>
            Your names, personality, and oh,<br>
            How does the time go by!<br>
            Or maybe a forest, green and lush,<br>
            Surrounded by endless brush,<br>
            And bushes and sticks; tall trees,<br>
            Covering, blocking for passage view?<br>
            Or maybe the ocean, and its<br>
            Endless sea, stretching out as<br>
            Far as the eye can see; or on a<br>
            Sailor-boat, greetin’ the captain<br>
            And the members of her crew:<br>
            Unbound, endless, free, or maybe<br>
            It’s a lie about the truth<br>
            That death can be eternal.<br>
            Or maybe it’s myself, sitting<br>
            And looking up to the night sky,<br>
            Sitting all by my lonesome<br>
            Tired and restless; or maybe<br>
            The dawn sea breaks up<br>
            And shines onto me and everything<br>
            I worry, I see, or do.<br>
            So, I don’t know where my<br>
            Worries shall go, and but I do know<br>
            Worries come and go, all from time to time;<br>
            But it is the future only looking<br>
            Forward too, and keeping current<br>
            Tides on high and low.<br>

            When you look at me and my heart, it’s when I shed and cry:<br>
            The tears I weep and show to you; your death seemed like a dream;<br>
            I would never ever think, not once in a million years, for you to die:<br>
            If this reality was the all basis of hell, then I wished it not to seem.<br>
            <br>
            The falsage breaks, and how I would remember all your dastardly conversations:<br>
            O, it seemed like the good times would never end,<br>
            And it would feel that bondage of us is divine sent; of opposite revelations.<br>
            You were such a friend; you were such a godsend…<br>
            <br>
            To I! But it is only me still standing here to cry and eternal torment! —<br>
            Right now, all I want to do right now is to curse the world;<br>
            This world is only deserving in its hatred. But death laid dormant,<br>
            And awaited… Yes, awaited for me as if things unfurled.<br>
            <br>
            Were it was I to die in your stead, in your place, instead of you,<br>
            Just I wonder what the world would behold to you:<br>
            The mysteries of your mind, the time stopped; only of what I knew…<br>
            But it’s only I being here to weep and cry, oh whatever shall I do?<br>

            Twinkle amidst the nightful stars that winters’ tales<br>
            Spring to life from the opera that mourns<br>
            Between the hours of sun and half-past noon<br>
            To the sounds of burgundy on footprint trace<br>
            On the side of covered snow down sidewalk<br>
            By the streets pass when people gone and fro;<br>
            Then to be blocked of passerby’s and cars gleam<br>
            Of sirens matrix doubt ringed interred by our ears:<br>
            And nightly whispers near the signposts do ream<br>

            Taken with assuming jokes of clash vanities<br>
            Imtember with the lovely song from above<br>

            O, what I’ll give for the Coordinates Eye!<br>
            What fairer takes for foreign land,<br>
            And to see the sea and the sand,<br>
            Noticing out the dreams of common man;<br>
            Yet you noticed, so you reached out your hand<br>
            And you sought the things you didn’t know,<br>
            For winter comes, and whiteness snow.<br>
            From that frost is a hellish gaze<br>
            That give brutal monsters a stone-cold face,<br>
            And voyages beyond the grove of forgotten land,<br>
            As you dreamed about the warming sand;<br>
            But nothing the eye can deceive to disgrace,<br>
            And give false barrow for the Coordinates Eye.<br>
            <br>
            O, I shall tell you of the seasons,<br>
            How they roam and soar the sky.<br>
            But a golden harp told a lie,<br>
            And I could tell your beauteous face<br>
            Was disgusted for me; and what I didn’t know<br>
            I once asked to forgive: O, I did ask,<br>
            And pleaded! And begged!<br>
            But no, I’ll never think again about you:<br>
            For you are a liar, a deceiver;<br>
            A cheating scar of a leaver.<br>
            So I ask you to be gone,<br>
            And to leave this place,<br>
            And forever not to return.<br>
            <br>
            The Coordinates Eye I saw from horror<br>
            In distant dreams to see frozen scraps,<br>
            And blood and scars; even a golden mace,<br>
            Like a momentous horse running a race,<br>
            Outdoing the rest, forwarding the pace,<br>
            But enough of that!<br>
            The Coordinates Eye I saw and seen,<br>
            From the distant Heaven from my dream,<br>
            Saw myself, then spoke unto me:<br>
            “O, wise and fortunate Captain, the seas forbids;<br>
            Therefore forever waters that stricken<br>
            The tremendous gold that you possess.<br>
            Your carriage I ask to come to sand<br>
            To seek out the distant, foreign land.<br>
            Paradise awaits for you, O Captain;<br>
            Go seek out the light.<br>
            No more fairing in the night.<br>
            Bask for what is the greatest, the best,<br>
            The most perfect; now seek out this test,<br>
            And I give you farewell and Fortune,<br>
            From my Coordinates Eye.”<br>
            <br>
            I then awoke from my dream,<br>
            Paradise then seemed like a theme;<br>
            A test for me to forego,<br>
            What future and misfortune I do not know.<br>
            But, winter… winter I must go.<br>
            Autumn, I loved and know.<br>
            Spring, what bounty you can give,<br>
            Summer, you give us a will to live.<br>

            Paradise, to redeem myself from sin;<br>
            From the least of me so I can win.<br>
            The journey I got from the Coordinates Eye,<br>
            So from the mortal world I’ll say goodbye,<br>
            But first before I go,<br>
            I want to tell my beauty to the world:<br>
            <br>
            O, the world I see out in the night sky,<br>
            The sky would’ve told you, “I love you.”<br>
            The animals and nomads of the land<br>
            Gives life from your hand.<br>
            Therefore I think of everything:<br>
            The color blue, and bells rung,<br>
            From the voices of my song.<br>
            From the Coordinates Eye<br>
            I, at last, say my goodbye<br>
            So I’ll go up to Paradise.<br>

          <h1 class="font-ubuntu">Winter</h1>
          <p class="font-roboto">
            If there was one thing in the world I could see joyfully,<br>
            It would be winter, and how her cold and her snow<br>
            Would place themselves over me; and they would cover<br>
            Me in white, as else with the rest of the world.<br>
            By glaze I saw in sleep I then became alive;<br>
            If I ever was alive. But maybe I could call out,<br>
            And ask winter how you feel and how…<br>
            How the winter doth feels about me.<br>
            <br>
            I could rest by a tree and see it shallow,<br>
            Where the birds sing it all the more hollow,<br>
            And to see the leaves fall frozen stiff,<br>
            Clueless; wandering by them all: why ever do they fall?<br>
            I could continue on about the other things,<br>
            But all things arrive at one: once things born<br>
            Now was withering and decaying beyond the scope<br>
            Of things beyond. And by that statement bores a question:<br>
            If I do know an answer, may I keep myself to it all?<br>

            If there was one thing in the world I could see joyfully,<br>
            It would be to see the winter. But beyond the grave I couldn’t<br>
            See what I could become; so I was amorphous,<br>
            But I could hear all the rude-ish judgement<br>
            From the mouths of many from the world I left.<br>
            If you all had at least once think that I was a fool,<br>
            A bastard, an evil man, a freak;<br>
            But I could see from my eye<br>
            All your spoken thoughts of truths and eyes.<br>
            If I could speak and confront your confoundment,<br>
            (And dare I say, the shock off your faces,)<br>
            All I have to ask from you all is an honest conversation;<br>
            And I know hatred is enviable, and some will misunderstand,<br>
            And some will think less and judge from<br>
            The deepest regions of your heart;<br>
            But I go on to converse:<br>
            “If there was one thing in the world...<br>
            One thing joyfully…<br>
            It would be winter,<br>
            And her winter snow.”<br>
            And all those voices would reply back:<br>
            “Why only one thing in the world?<br>
            And why her winter snow?<br>
            Do doth shape and curl,<br>
            In death, to let it go?”<br>
            And I would think, and think, and think.<br>
            Was death an excuse of me for my hatred?<br>
            And what is winter to me?<br>
            Does she not revolve around me?<br>
            “Does not,” I spoke aloud,<br>
            “The winter belong to me?”<br>
            After I spoke, those people kneeled upon me,<br>
            And chanted a verse of holy poetry.<br>
            (O, the irony!)<br>
            “We pray to you and give grace;<br>
            Please no more death upon this place.<br>
            We ask of you to be our light,<br>
            To fairer be-gone unholy night.<br>
            Sacred, sacred, holy bless,<br>
            Love us at our best!<br>
            We are sinners, far and wide,<br>
            So give us as our guide.<br>
            And to take and be aside,<br>
            We’ll serve you in death and life.<br>
            So give grace to us and perform<br>
            The basis of holy miracles<br>
            That hovers like a storm;<br>
            Your lasting mysticals<br>
            We say, ‘Our lord and grace.’”<br>
            <br>
            To hear that as they praised that chant,<br>
            I had to admit to myself: I felt something,<br>
            An emotion of guilt and hope, something…<br>
            Something I never felt before,<br>
            Not ever in my thousands of years of being.<br>
            No… my beginning of time as the beholder of winter.<br>
            <br>
            If there was one thing in the world I could see joyfully,<br>
            Would be my winter, and how her winter snow falls.<br>
            A contrast of Autumn.<br>
            <br>
            O, I give the one thing the world has joyfully:<br>
            The winter, and her great winter snow.<br>

            Nothing compares – nor riches, fame, or glory,<br>
            For yourself makes itself into legendary story.<br>
            <br>
            But nothing your supple mouth, and beauteous eyes:<br>
            Bluer than that makes the daylight sky,<br>
            I speak, but softly, thus my heart:<br>
            Beating so heavily your sight gives it start;<br>
            <br>
            I confess my love, purer than the spring,<br>
            And may many joys will happily bring.<br>

            Inside the rainstorm asundered that went on forever,<br>
            The cries of one could be heard,<br>
            Inside a cabin that two men roam, but encountered Death's dome,<br>
            And the blood of dove's and birds.<br>
            <br>
            Alive, but barely weakening one man cried,<br>
            And the other with his weaponry out:<br>
            The monsters of the night, they surround in smoky sight;<br>
            Games be played - one winner that be proud.<br>
            <br>
            Deception of choice will one make - to live for one's sake!<br>
            To give up the past of his friend,<br>
            Who is one that monsters will choke, thus hardened this bloke.<br>
            To be or not to be; if one ends up dead.<br>
            <br>
            Hours and such minutes has passed, never thought they'll last:<br>
            The monsters, they came,<br>
            And the fought between two, never though monsters would knew;<br>
            The lives - of monsters - they claimed.<br>
            <br>
            Knifes chipped and bullet rung, empathy did Death's choir sung.<br>
            Sunrise may be soon away,<br>
            But not enough for savior or miracle, for cries were seen lyrical:<br>
            Blood and grasp has claimed his last day.<br>
            <br>
            The only survivor man had stand, his firm grasped, and looked at the land,<br>
            He walked out, the body laid;<br>
            He never looked back, only then he sighed and let his wrath attacked:<br>
            The monsters had something to fear this day.<br>
            <br>
            And when it finally ended, Heavens and Hell be splendid,<br>
            The man looked and saw the sky:<br>
            His look mesmerizing, but underneath his expression despising.<br>
            Why did his friend, who he loved, died and lied?<br>

            As once upon a night so dreary,<br>
            Wondering, thinking, with thoughts so weary:<br>
            So bright it seems, my contemporaries, in brilliancy;<br>
            The buoyant of simple and inspiring cause<br>
            That with floating of heights so inured to reach,<br>
            It towers upon the heavens and beyond,<br>
            Where of average and normal souls<br>
            May hope to dream and look upon – to gaze<br>
            Upwards to the bright sky, and reach the stars<br>
            To discover each and every one<br>
            Of its undiscovered stories.<br>
            This is where we dream<br>
            Of a journey that is bring’d thusly so:<br>
            A time of adventure; of unsung and born heroes,<br>
            Wielding a might against the gaze of unhourly abyss.<br>
            A mind with a dream – a mind to invent a story so brilliant<br>
            Brings a wonderment to all of mankind<br>
            Against our own fallacy, an example of raising from the ashes.<br>
            So, weep not against the eye of the storm,<br>
            Breaking those of ironclad will.<br>
            We will fall, but we will fall with a purpose,<br>
            And return stronger than ever.<br>
            It is a reminder to dream of a story<br>
            Filled with all those young, childlike wonders<br>
            Pacing with steady steps to a world<br>
            Ready for such stars.<br>
            And with a rest on a night so dreary,<br>
            As sun may rise to future anew:<br>
            Sing a toast to a melody most merry,<br>
            And let loose the brilliance within you.<br>

            If to be the hanger of a clasping dream,<br>

            But when escaping reality is only a snooze away,<br>
            I’ll just have to wait, because it’s here<br>
            Where I become a new man, a better man<br>
            Then I was the day before; and this is where<br>
            I don’t have to wonder about the pain.<br>
            Only but a clasping dream: a wholeful’s<br>
            Telling inside a storybook, to see the things<br>
            Regular life cannot. This is why I dream,<br>
            And why for dream’s sake will I continue,<br>
